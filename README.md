An online version of the classic "Simon" electronic board game.

2. Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.

3. Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

4. Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly.

5. If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means that the game is over, and the sequence of signals ends.
